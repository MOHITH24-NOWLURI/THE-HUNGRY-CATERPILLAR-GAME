# THE-HUNGRY-CATERPILLAR-GAME
# Caterpillar Game üêõ

A simple and fun Python game where you control a caterpillar to eat leaves and grow longer. Built using the built-in `turtle` graphics library.

## Features

- Controls a caterpillar that moves using arrow keys.
- Caterpillar grows longer and speeds up each time it eats a leaf.
- Randomly places leaves on the screen for the caterpillar to eat.
- Shows your score on the screen.
- Ends the game if the caterpillar moves outside the window boundary.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- No external dependencies; uses only Python's built-in `turtle` and `random` modules.

## How It Works
